# PHP_Course: Learning enough PHP to write Web Applications

This repository contains course material developed for the reader to learn enough PHP to write Web applications.

Prerequisites include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This material does not cover software architecture such as the programming of a PHP MVC Framework for Web Application development.

PHP is a general purpose language and can be used for other purposes, but it is geared toward building Web Applications, and thus this material will make the assumption that this is the use case.

## Software requirements

A simple way to run PHP code and see the result in a Web browser is to use an *AMP stack*.
An AMP stack is a software bundle that includes
- Apache: a Web Server application, alternatively, NGINX can be used as a Web Server application
- MySQL: a relational database management system, to maintain databases
- PHP: the PHP interpreter module

These ~AMP stacks~ are often called *LAMP* stack when they run on Linux and *WAMP* stacks on Windows.
*XAMPP* is such an AMP stack that is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
XAMPP contains the software listed above and more, and is available from [apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
