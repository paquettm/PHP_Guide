# PHP - AJAX Introduction




AJAX is about updating parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
## What is AJAX?


AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.


AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.


AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small 
amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is 
possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.


Classic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the 
content should change.


Examples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and 
Facebook tabs.
## How AJAX Works## AJAX is Based on Internet Standards


AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:
* XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)


* JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)


* CSS (to style the data)


* XML (often used as the format for transferring data)

AJAX applications are browser- and platform-independent!

## Google Suggest


AJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.


Google Suggest 
is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: 
When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off 
to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.
