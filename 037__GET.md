# PHP Superglobal - $\_GET


Super global variables are built-in 
variables that are always available in all scopes.
## PHP $\_GET


PHP $\_GET is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form 
with method="get".


$\_GET can also collect data sent in the URL.


Assume we have an HTML page that contains a hyperlink with parameters:


```
<html>
<body>
<a href="test_get.php?subject=PHP&web=cstutoring.ca">Test $GET</a>
</body>
</html>
```
When a user clicks on the link "Test $GET", the parameters "subject" and 
"web" are sent to "test_get.php", and you can then access their values 
in "test_get.php" with $\_GET.


The example below shows the code in "test_get.php":```
<html>
<body>

 <?php echo "Study " . $_GET['subject'] . " at " . $_GET['web'];?>

</body>
</html>```
