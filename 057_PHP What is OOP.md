From PHP5, you can also write PHP code in an object-oriented 
style.


Object-Oriented programming is faster and easier to execute.
## PHP What is OOP?


OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.


Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform 
operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about 
creating objects that contain both data and functions.


Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural 
programming:
* OOP is faster and easier to execute


* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs


* OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes 
  the 
  code easier to maintain, modify and debug


* OOP makes it possible to create full reusable 
  applications with less code and shorter development timeTip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about 
reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are 
common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them 
instead of repeating it.


## PHP - What are Classes and Objects?


Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.


Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and 
objects:


## class


Fruit

## objects


Apple


Banana


Mango
Another example:


## class


Car

## objects


Volvo


Audi


Toyota
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.


When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the 
properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.
