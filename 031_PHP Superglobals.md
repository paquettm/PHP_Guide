Superglobals were introduced in PHP 4.1.0, and are built-in 
variables that are always available in all scopes.
## PHP Global Variables - Superglobals


Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they 
are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any 
function, class or file without having to do anything special.


The PHP superglobal variables are:
* $GLOBALS


* $\_SERVER


* $\_REQUEST


* $\_POST


* $\_GET


* $\_FILES


* $\_ENV


* $\_COOKIE


* $\_SESSIONThe next chapters will explain some of the superglobals, and the rest will be 
explained in later chapters.
